# Sticky Delay Bug Fix

- Download latest release and unzip it in `steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2 Dedicated Server/tf`

## Updating

An update might break how the plugin interacts with the game, in this case:

- Open https://asherkin.github.io/vtable/ with Firefox
- Pick TF2 Server
- Search for SecondaryAttack
- Pick any (it should be fine)
- Modify tf/addons/sourcemod/SecondaryAttack.txt, change the "windows" value with the W number and the "linux" value with the L number
- Optionally, tell me to update it
